#First Java Projects. 

In this project I have created 4classes under one package. In the classes I have demonstrated basic java command usage and the following:

Workshop action items based on:

1.	Create a project to give any name, create a package, and inside the package, create a class, then write a program to print "Hello World."
2.	Update the name of the package and class name.
3.	Write a program to print the value of a variable that contains a text.
4.	Write a program to declare all primitive data types of variables and print the values.
5.	Declare three types of variables and print the values of all those variables.
6.	Write a program to print the value of a variable from Class A into Class B (Class name is for an example here. Give the separate names of your classes)
7.	Declare a variable outside the primary method and print the value inside the main method without creating any object.
